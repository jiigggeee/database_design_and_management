Seth's Apothecary is a disabled, veteran owned, mmj care center (also known everywhere else as a dispensary yet state law in MA names differently yet for the sake of this project dispensary will be used in diagramming & functional pieces) group in Massachusetts. This center group has been in operation for five years and specializes in medical grade cannabis cultivation and sales across their four locations with the main goal of helping the sick and disabled of Bristol and Norfolk counties with pain management, medical treatment side effects & end of life care. A percentage of monthly profit is donated to disabled veteran charities in and around Attleboro, MA (the location of the first and main dispensary). Seth's Apothecary is more community-focused than canna-corporation and wishes to stay that way regardless of legislation and technology.

This care center group recently upgraded their database system from separate databases at each location (with very little to no access to other location information when that could be crucial to patient and caregiver sales) to an Oracle ERP Cloud service that includes a connected Enterprise Cloud Database that can be accessed at any of the four locations. The third party payment system, that also includes state government sales restriction monitoring, feeds into the ERP service and the database. Having the connection between all locations is meant to improve accessibility and improve sales. The cloud service is also meant to improve and evolve the care center group's cultivation processing and product monitoring.
